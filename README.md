Easy, Smart and efficient Banking

We have developed a secure web-portal, which not only reduces the workload on bankemployees but it also simplifies the banking requirements of the customers.

The web-app has role-based functionalities and access rights. This is on both the fronts, that is bank administration and customer interface.

Functionalities:
1. Gives the admin right to add, remove, change the role and salary of the employees in his branch.
2. Every employee gets to do his routine work, and every slip can now be replaced with a data strip in the portal.
3. Customers can do remote banking, which includes requesting credit cards/chequebooks, transfering money, apply for loan, get account balance, etc.

Technologies Used:
1. The Backend is developed on the Flask Framework.
2. MySQL database is used to store neccessary data.
3. HTML, CSS, Javascript makes up the frontend.
4. Various Python Libraries as per requirement.

Further Scope:
Integration with any payment api can be done for transfer of money outside our bank.
